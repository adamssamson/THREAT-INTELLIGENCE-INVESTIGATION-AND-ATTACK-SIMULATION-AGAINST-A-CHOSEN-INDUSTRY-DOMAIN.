## üìñ Overview

This repository presents a detailed threat intelligence investigation and simulated attack scenario centered on **LockBit 3.0**, a notorious ransomware group. The target domain is **Mayo Clinic**, representing a critical healthcare infrastructure. The report includes:

- üéØ Threat actor profiling  
- üõ†Ô∏è Reconnaissance tools and techniques  
- üß™ Simulated kill chain walkthrough  
- üß≠ MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping  
- üõ°Ô∏è Tactical security recommendations  
- üìÇ References and attribution disclaimers

## üß† Executive Summary

Mayo Clinic, a premier institution in global healthcare and medical research, operates a highly sensitive digital infrastructure that supports patient data, clinical systems, and research networks. These assets make the Clinic a high-value target for cyber adversaries‚Äîespecially ransomware operators seeking maximum disruption and financial gain.

This investigation focuses on **LockBit 3.0**, a formidable Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) group known for rapid encryption and double extortion. Using Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) and passive reconnaissance techniques, we simulate a kill chain and map potential intrusion paths based on adversarial behaviors observed in past LockBit campaigns.

Recommendations are offered to fortify cybersecurity resilience, detection readiness, and incident response agility‚Äîaligning with the MITRE ATT&CK Framework for threat modeling.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Recommendations

### üîê Credential & Access Hardening

- Enforce phishing-resistant MFA for remote access  
- Disable unused remote services (e.g., RDP, SSH) and control access by IP  
- Monitor abnormal login behavior across privileged accounts  

### üìß Phishing & Email Protection

- Train staff to recognize and report phishing attempts  
- Use email filters, attachment sandboxing  
- Implement DMARC, SPF, and DKIM  

### üñ•Ô∏è Endpoint & Network Defense

- Enable antivirus and behavioral threat detection  
- Whitelist approved applications and block unauthorized executables  
- Monitor usage of PsExec, Mimikatz, and Rclone  

### üìä Threat Detection & Logging

- Watch for LSASS access, PowerShell execution, registry changes  
- Detect exfiltration tools like StealBit and FileZilla  
- Monitor for event log clearing and deletion of shadow copies  

### üîê Network Segmentation & Backup Strategy

- Isolate critical systems from general user access  
- Maintain offline, immutable backups and regularly test restoration  
- Restrict lateral movement protocols like SMB  

### üõ†Ô∏è Vulnerability Management

- Rapidly patch known exploited vulnerabilities  
- Monitor exploitation attempts against public-facing services
